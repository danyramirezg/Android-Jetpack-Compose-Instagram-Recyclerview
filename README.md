# Android Jetpack Compose Recyclerview - Country list.

In this project you will see a list of contries (that I haved traveled so far) :sweat_smile:

This is a recycler view as grid layout wrote in Jetpack Compose and it has a TextButton that scrolls up to go to the first item in the recyclerview.

In this project you will see a sticky header implemented as well, just keep in mind that when you want to see how it works, go to the
"preview" and uncomment this line of code:

```
    CountryStickyHeader()
```
